Rough approximation of the PEAR library of the same name

This is by no means a proper implementation of what is in the PEAR library. It was mostly made so that I could use some functions for a project where I could not install the full PEAR PHP library. Function names are similar, and parameters and returns are based on the PEAR documentation, but the actual code would be different. This is so that where appropriate I could rather use the actual PEAR library instead of this workaround.
